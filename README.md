# modern-x86-assembly-language-programming-linux
Source code for 'Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming' by Daniel Kusswurm, 'translated' to nasm and gcc for Linux.

This repository isn't complete. Some examples still need to be translated especially those with GDI libraries.  In time I want to use SDL for that.

The original license is : https://github.com/Apress/modern-x86-assembly-language-programming/blob/master/LICENSE.txt and repeated in this repository.
